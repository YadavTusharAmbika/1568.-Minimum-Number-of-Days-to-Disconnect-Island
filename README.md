1568  problem is about how many days it would take to disconnect the land 
land is 1 and water is 0
1 land or more then one land means the grids is connected if the grids is vacant means land is disconnected
the numbeer of wwater means number of days like when it would take the 1 days to disconnected the grid means total days is 1 


approach is 
number of island > 1 
number of island == 0
